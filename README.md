Put all the .py files into a folder.
In the same folder create a folder called "img".
Put all the photos from my img github directory there.
In the "img" folder create an "enemies" folder.
And there place the folders of all the enemies. 
Each folder should be named after the enemy and contain 3 folders called "walk", "attack", "death". Inside those you will place the corresponding enemy pictures.
